# Deep Learning Assignment 2

In this assignment, I created interactive Jupyter notebooks using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to build deep learning models.

The notebooks offer hands-on experience with [perceptron models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), allowing students to explore key concepts like supervised machine-learning, classifier training, perceptron learning algorithm, and visualization using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to better understand deep learning in action.

## Get Started

You can open the main notebook file [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) and [`main.pdf`](main.pdf) using your favorite viewer.

Please check out the previous results or run the notebook to reproduce the results.
